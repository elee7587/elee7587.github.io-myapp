    <h1>Welcome to the Restaurant Hygiene Rating</h1>
    <p>
      This web app allows you to upload a dataset of restaurant reviews and related information in CSV format.
      We require certain information including restaurant names, text reviews, cuisines, average ratings, and labels indicating the sentiment of the reviews (positive or negative).
      This web app will provide insights into restaurant hygiene ratings based on customer reviews.
      It will analyze the data using a machine learning model to predict restaurant's outcomes based on review sentiments and other features.
      As this is a supervied machine learning model, the model will need previously labeled data in order for this model to be succesful.
      Please answer the specifications provided by the upload button. Those specifications will ensure we can process your data correctly and give you the most accurate results.
